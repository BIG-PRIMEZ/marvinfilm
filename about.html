            <h2>Capturing love stories, one frame at a time</h2>
            <p>With over 8 years specializing in wedding cinematography, we've built our reputation on one principle: your love story deserves to be told beautifully. We've had the honor of documenting over 150 weddings across Nigeria and beyond.</p>
            <p>We believe in the power of film to preserve the emotions, the laughter, the tears, and all the moments in between. That's why we approach each wedding with obsessive attention to detail and a commitment to capturing authentic, timeless memories.</p>
            <p>Our process is personal and unobtrusive. We take the time to understand your story, your vision, and what matters most to you, then craft a film that feels uniquely yours.</p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>marvinfilm began with a simple belief: that every wedding has a unique story worth telling. What started as a passion for capturing love stories has grown into a dedicated wedding cinematography studio serving couples throughout Nigeria and beyond.</p>
          <p>We've had the privilege of documenting weddings ranging from intimate elopements in Big Sur to grand celebrations in Napa Valley. Each wedding has taught us something new and deepened our appreciation for the art of wedding filmmaking.</p>

          <blockquote class="pullquote">
            "We don't just film weddings—we preserve the emotions, the connections, and the fleeting moments that make your day unforgettable."
          </blockquote>

          <p>Today, we work with couples who value authenticity and artistry. Couples who want more than just documentation—they want a cinematic film that captures the true essence of their celebration. Our work is driven by genuine connection, shaped by collaboration, and defined by an unwavering commitment to telling your story beautifully.</p>
